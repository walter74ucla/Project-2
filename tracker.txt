I tried to delete this...<div class="icon icon-small fa fa-<%=user.activities[i].habit[0].icon%>">...still got an error, so I put it back.
This does not work for the first user in the user list, the second user works, and so on???
DONE.
Micah deleted two users with foundHabit: null from the mongo database via mongo commands.  Hopefully, this will be a permanent fix.

=====Finished review here on Oct 30, 2019-2134======================

On the user show page, when logged in, the delete button worked on the activity listed in the recent activities section.

Update??? On the user show page, when logged in, the edit button does not work on the activity listed in the recent activities section.  It yields the following error..."Cannot POST /activities/5db797e8348fbf190df52c75/5db9b504e2da2d2dccc64d46/0/edit"

On the edit user page, clicking Delete Profile caused a throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event...controllers/users.js:224:17

Login check worked, "Username or password in incorrect" when using credentials not found in database.

Update??? Perhaps add a users index link in the header
