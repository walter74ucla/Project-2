## HOME PAGE

All users begin on a landing page showing all other visible users and their most recent habit activity.

Unregistered users only have the ability to view the home page.

Visitors have the option to register to become a user, log-in, or remain logged out. On registration, users have the ability to choose whether their activity will be visible to other users.

Registered and logged-in users can access an index of all visible users with links to their personal pages, and an index of all activities.

## REGISTERED AND LOGGED IN USER

Registered and logged in users have access to a personal user page where they view their habits list, past instances of activity, and add new instances activity.

In order to add a new habit, the user selects from an activities dropdown or chooses “other” (stretch goal: custom activities) and enters the amount of time and the date they performed the activity.

Users can look back and edit/delete past habits, as well as see a list of all activities in their history, and past sessions of new activities. Visitors can sort past activity to only show certain activities or only show activities from certain periods. (stretch)

If a user is visible, they can be followed by others users and their activity instances can be “liked” by other users, and they can also follow other users and “like” their activity (stretch).

A registered user can also choose to delete their account and all instances of past activity.
